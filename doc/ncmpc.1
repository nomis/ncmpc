.SH "NAME"
ncmpc \- curses Music Player Daemon (MPD) client.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ncmpc
[options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ncmpc is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon.
ncmpc connects to a MPD running on a machine on the local 
network.

By default, ncmpc connects to localhost:6600. 
This can be changed either at compile\-time, or by exporting the 
MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment variables, or by the command line
options \-\-host and \-\-port.

$ ncmpc \-\-host=musicserver \-\-port=44000

To use a password with mpd, set MPD_HOST to password@host 
or use the command line option \-\-password. Values from 
the command line overrides values from the environment.

.SH "KEYS"
When ncmpc starts it tries to read user-defined key bindings from the ~/.ncmpc/keys file. If no user-defined key bindings are found then ncmpc tries to load the global key bindings from $SYSCONFDIR/ncmpc/keys (the actual path is displayed on the help screen). 

You can view ncmpc's key bindings by pressing '1' (help) when 
ncmpc is running. To edit key bindings press 'K' and use the key editor in ncmpc.
.SH "SONG FORMAT"
Format of song display for status and the list window.
The metadata delimiters are: %artist%, %albumartist%, %composer%, %performer%, %title%, %album%, %shortalbum%, %track%, %genre%, %name%, %time%, %date%, %file%, %shortfile%.

The [] operators are used to group output such that if none of the metadata delimiters between '[' and ']' are matched, then none of the characters between '[' and ']' are output; literal text is always output. '&' and '|' are logical operators for AND and OR. '#' is used to escape characters.

Some useful examples for format are:

   "%file%" 

and 

   "[[%artist% \- ]%title%]|%file%"

Another one is:

   "[%artist%|(artist n/a)] - [%title%|(title n/a)]"

.SH "CHAT PROTOCOL"
If ncmpc has been compiled with "chat" support, it uses the client-to-client protocol available in MPD 0.17 or higher to communicate with other clients. In order to receive messages it subscribes to the channel with the name "chat", and displays any message sent there as-is. When the user enters a message, it is first with the prefix specified by the \fBchat-prefix\fR option (or the default prefix), and then sent to the "chat" channel for others to read.
.SH "BUGS"
Report bugs on http://www.musicpd.org/mantis/
.SH "NOTE"
Since MPD uses UTF\-8, ncmpc needs to convert characters to the 
charset used by the local system. If you get character conversion errors when your running ncmpc you probably need to set up your locale. This is done by setting any of the LC_CTYPE, LANG or LC_ALL environment variables (LC_CTYPE only affects character handling).
